This is the game of PawnChess, a modified version of chess. The only pieces available are pawns which can only move one space at a time. Each pawn piece may also only be moved once per turn.

There are two types of move a pawn can make:
    Forward Move: If there is not another piece in the piece directly in front of the pawn, then the pawn may move one space forward.
    Capturing Move: If there is an enemy pawn on a foward diagonal square, then the pawn may move and capture the enemy pawn.


If a player can capture a pawn by moving diagonally, then they must always make a capturing move. After a capturing move, they may move another piece if available.

Win conditions:
    1. Getting a pawn to the other side of the board
    2. The other player does not have any moves available at the start of their turn
